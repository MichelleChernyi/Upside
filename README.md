# Upside
An interactive mental health app that helps users learn about and cope with their emotions, giving targeted recommendations based on user feedback 

## Running the program
When main.py is run, the program will start running.

You should see a medium sized window appear with a picture that says “Upside”, a label that says, “what emotion are you feeling today?”, and 10 buttons with different emotions. 

1. Pick an emotion
2. Then pick between ‘description’, ‘effects', 'causes', and 'coping mechanisms'
3. If you click on ‘description’, ‘effects', or 'causes' you will receive differenet information about the emotion
4. If you click on 'coping mechanisms', you will see:
   * A list of different coping mechanisms
   * A text box to add coping mechanisms and pick if they are healthy or unhealthy
   * An "unhealthy habit tracker", which if clicked begins a count of the number of days the user has been clean of unhealthy coping mechanisms 
   * A "journal" button which allows to pick a coping mechanism from a dropdown menu and write your thoughts about it. 
      * You can choose if the coping mechanism was useful and click submit
      * If you clicked "yes" the journal will be saved to the "past journal entries"
      * If you clciked "no", the coping mechanism will be discarded and will no longer be in the list of coping mechanisms.
